## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Desktop replay viewer.** `gradle :desktop:replay --args="--file <replay>"` plays a recorded run
  back in the rendered game. Recorded actions are applied through `ActionMapper`, which hands them to
  `Hero.handle` — the same call the game's own cell selector makes — so attack-versus-loot-versus-
  stairs-versus-menu resolves exactly as it does for a player. The HUD shows step count, seed, hero,
  recorded score, depth, turns, speed and any divergence.

  Two engine hooks were needed, both general rather than replay-specific: `Game.lockCellInput`
  disables the cell selector each frame so nothing but the recording can inject an action, and
  `Game.setSceneClass` lets an entry point that builds the game choose its initial scene.

  Entering through `InterlevelScene` with `Mode.DESCEND` is what makes this work: `InterlevelScene`
  switches to `GameScene` hardcoded, so a `GameScene` subclass would never be entered. A static
  `frameDriver` hook pumps playback instead, and the recording is watched in the real scene with real
  sprites.


- `PPO.rolloutCap` bounds collection between updates. It is not only a memory guard: PPO measures
  how far the policy has drifted since it collected the data, so frequent updates are what PPO
  wants anyway.

- `gradle :superintelligence:gradcheck` (or `gradcheck --verbose`) finite-difference checks the
  network's analytic gradients against central differences and exits non-zero on a mismatch, so a
  broken backward pass fails loudly instead of silently training the wrong function.

### Fixed

- **An uncapped PPO rollout was an out-of-memory crash waiting to happen.** Collection stored every
  step of an episode until the next update. A step is dominated by its packed grid at ~49KB and
  `turnLimitTotal` is 40000, so one long episode is ~1.9GB against a 1536m worker heap.
  `PPO.collect()` now stops at `rolloutCap` (default 2048, ~98MB) and leaves the env mid-episode,
  resuming it with the recurrent state intact on the next call, so a long episode is collected
  across several calls instead of being cut short. Each collection is its own advantage segment.

  An update invalidates the hidden state of an episode still in progress - it changes the weights
  that state came from, and resets the state itself to shuffle minibatches. A weight change is now
  an information boundary and the agent forgets, because otherwise where updates happened to land
  would silently change an episode's actions and the same seed would stop reproducing.

- Three headless crashes that the scripted policy never reached but a random one walks into
  immediately, all the same shape of problem as a missing sprite:
  - Blobs had no emitter, so any of the fifteen blob types calling `emitter.pour()` from
    `evolve()` died with an NPE. `LevelPipeline` now attaches them alongside sprites.
  - `GameScene.cancel()` and `cancelCellSelector()` dereferenced a null `cellSelector`, so using
    any item crashed.
  - `GameScene.spellSprite()` read `scene.spells` with no null check, unlike the `emitter()`
    directly beside it, so eating food crashed.

- **The policy network's gradients were wrong in five separate ways, so training optimised a
  function other than the policy loss.** The network had never been executed before this, so none
  of the failures showed up as an exception - they produced plausible numbers and an optimiser
  step that moved nothing.
  - `Conv2D.backward` and `Dense.backward` omitted their activation derivatives, so no gradient
    reached the convolution or the trunk weights.
  - `LSTM.backward` read `h` and `c` that `forward` had already advanced, and used `c_t` where
    the derivative needs `c_{t-1}`. It now caches the gate pre-activations and both prior states.
  - `Network.backward` copied the hidden gradient into the LSTM *before* the heads had accumulated
    into it, so the recurrent cell always received zero.
  - The LSTM's input gradient buffer was never sized or cleared, so the gradient never reached the
    trunk. It is now sized from the cell's input width and refilled by `backward`.
  - `Network.headGradient` hand-rolled `W^T * dOut`, which skipped the head's own parameter
    gradient and its tanh derivative. It now goes through `Dense.backward`.
  - Also fixed the LSTM output being written back into the wider trunk buffer, so the heads were
    fed the wrong width, and a trunk input gradient buffer that was too narrow by the
    inventory and hero block.

  Verified against central differences: `gradle :superintelligence:gradcheck` compares analytic
  gradients to numeric ones on 112 sampled parameters across all seven layers, and fails the build
  if they disagree. The check has been confirmed to fail when a derivative is deliberately removed.

- **More identity-hash iteration in gameplay and level generation.** Collections keyed on
  identity hash codes iterate in a different order in every JVM, and `java.lang.Enum` inherits
  `Object.hashCode`, so enum-keyed maps are affected too. Sites where that order reached the
  outcome were made insertion-ordered:
  - `Char.buffs(Class)` returned a `HashSet`. Callers sort or iterate the result while consuming
    the RNG or folding floats non-associatively - `ShieldBuff.processDamage` distributes damage
    across barriers in that order - so damage and death could differ per run. Now a
    `LinkedHashSet`.
  - `Random.chances(HashMap)` picks off the map's iteration order, so the secret laboratory and
    secret library chose a different potion or scroll every run, changing what the floor
    contained. Their chance tables, and the ones in `WandOfCorruption`, `UnstableSpell`,
    `UnstableBrew` and `ChaoticCenser`, are now `LinkedHashMap`.
  - `Mob.chooseEnemy` resolved equal-distance and equally-attackable candidates by iteration
    order, so which of two equidistant mobs got targeted varied. Now insertion-ordered.
  - `CursingTrap`, `VaultLevel` and `Hero` used `Collections.shuffle`, which ignores the seeded
    generator entirely and is therefore different on every run. Switched to `Random.shuffle`.

- **A seed longer than 20 characters was silently discarded**, and the run continued on a random
  seed. `GameSettings.getString(key, def, maxLength)` treats an over-long stored value as corrupt
  and overwrites it with the default, and `SPDSettings.customSeed()` reads with a 20 character
  cap. A rollout asked to reproduce would simply not reproduce, with nothing reporting it.
  `LevelPipeline.startRun` now verifies the seed survived the round trip and fails with an
  explanation instead.

- `gradle :superintelligence:rollout` and `:verify` never passed their own subcommand to the
  entry point, so `--args` was parsed as the command and both tasks failed. The subcommand is now
  prepended at execution time, which also keeps working when `--args` is supplied.

  Verified: 120 rollouts - 4 seeds x 5 hero classes x 6 repeats - produce one distinct score per
  seed/hero pair, and a recorded 499-step run re-executes exactly 4 times out of 4.

## [4.1.0] - 2026-10-06

### Fixed

- **The environment is now reproducible across processes.** An audit found that recording a run
  and re-executing it in a fresh JVM usually reproduced it but not always - six runs of one seed
  produced four distinct traces. Three causes:
  - `Random.resetGenerators()` installs an unseeded base generator, and `Dungeon.init` called it
    after pushing the seeded stack, discarding it. Only level generation drew from a seeded
    generator; mob turns, combat rolls and item drops did not. Added `Random.reseedBase(long)` and
    call it from `Dungeon.init` with the run seed.
  - `EntranceRoom.placeEarlyGuidePages` pushed an unseeded generator during level generation,
    deliberately, to keep meta progression out of levelgen. The first guidebook page therefore
    landed on a different tile in every process, making floor 1 irreproducible on its own. Now
    seeded from the floor's seed with a fixed offset.
  - `Actor.all`, `Actor.chars`, `Level.mobs` and `Level.blobs` were hash-based collections keyed on
    identity hash codes, so iteration order differed between JVM runs. `Actor.headlessStep` broke
    time ties on that order, so who moved first varied. All four are now insertion-ordered
    (`LinkedHashSet` / `LinkedHashMap`); membership semantics are unchanged.

  Verified: 10 traces of one seed across 10 separate JVMs produce one distinct result, and a
  recorded 299-step run re-executes exactly 5 times out of 5 with a bit-identical score.

- `GameScene.add(Heap)` left `heap.sprite` null when there is no scene, so trampling high grass
  dereferenced it and crashed a rollout.
- `Image.frame` derived its size from a null texture when there is no renderer.

### Added

- **Headless training framework** (`superintelligence` module). Implements the design in
  `superintelligence/docs.md` and `superintelligence/research.md`.
  - `headless`: libGDX and noosa shims so the game runs with no renderer, no window and no audio -
    silent `Audio`/`Sound`/`Music`, classpath-aware `Files`, in-memory `Preferences`, an inert
    `noosa.Game`, a fixed-size `Graphics`, and a `CharSprite` that resolves animations instantly so
    combat, doors and chests still resolve their bookkeeping.
  - `env`: `SPDEnv` with a reset/step interface; `LevelPipeline` that starts runs, drives the actor
    scheduler single-threaded and services floor transitions and chasm falls without entering the
    scene system; `ActionMapper` that injects decisions through `Hero.handle` and produces the
    legal-action mask; `WindowBridge` and `SlotAction` for dialogs and inventory.
  - `obs`: `ObservationEncoder` producing binary spatial planes (visible vs. remembered fog of war),
    a fixed-length inventory vector with per-slot identity, level, curse and identification state,
    and normalised hero scalars.
  - `reward`: `RewardModel` scoring by state diffing, a `RewardTerm` per documented reward and
    punishment, `RewardLedger` keeping per-term and per-floor totals, and `Curriculum` fading the
    dense shaping terms out as depth is mastered.
  - `rl`: `Network` (one convolution over the grid, an LSTM for fog-of-war memory, and heads for
    action, slot, target and value), `PPO` with masked sampling, clipped surrogate, GAE and Adam.
  - `train`: `Trainer` pooling episodes across worker JVMs over a binary stdin/stdout protocol,
    `SeedPool` implementing the one-seed to ten to hundred to random generalisation schedule.
  - `replay`: `Replay`/`ReplayRecorder`/`ReplayIO` recording decisions rather than consequences, and
    verifying playback reproduces.
  - `diag`: `RunReport` rendering the floor-by-floor breakdown with green/red colouring, per-term
    totals, and score-over-turns and score-over-floors graphs with floor transitions annotated.
  - `policy.ScriptedPolicy`: a network-free heuristic used as an environment smoke test and as the
    worker bootstrap before the first checkpoint exists.
  - Gradle tasks `rollout`, `replay`, `train`, `probeClasspath` and `workerJar`.

### Changed

- `ItemSpriteSheet.Icons` builds its `TextureFilm` on first use instead of in a static initialiser.
  Icon indices are game data and remain pure arithmetic, but item constructors no longer force a
  texture decode through a GL context.
- `CharSprite` gains `sprint`, `updateArmor`, `read` and `fall` as overridable no-ops, hoisted from
  `HeroSprite` and `MobSprite`, so game logic no longer depends on which sprite a character uses.
- `AttackIndicator.target`/`updateState`, `QuickSlotButton.target`, `GameScene.selectCell`,
  `GameScene.checkKeyHold` and `GameScene.resetKeyHold` tolerate absent UI singletons.
- `TextureCache.getBitmap` returns null without a GL context, and `TextureCache.get` no longer
  caches or wraps a null bitmap. `NinePatch` accepts a null texture and a new no-argument
  constructor for texture-free use. `Chrome.get` and `ShadowBox` return blank chrome without a
  renderer. `PlatformSupport.getSafeInsets` returns empty insets without a display.

### Added (game)

- `Actor.headlessStep()` - one turn-scheduler iteration with no render-thread handshake, for
  single-threaded headless rollouts.
- `GameScene.show` records a dialog when there is no scene; `GameScene.pendingCellListener` records
  an aiming request when there is no cell selector. `WndOptions.optionCount`,
  `optionSelectable` and `selectOption` plus `Button.press` let a caller enumerate and answer a
  dialog with no UI.
- `Item.throwAt()` - the bookkeeping half of `Item.cast`, without a projectile sprite.

### Documentation

- `superintelligence/TODO.md` - status against the design documents: what still needs doing, ordered
  by what unblocks learning first; deliberate deviations with the cost of each; and the source
  documents' references to classes that no longer exist in this version.

### Renamed

- `ReplayIO.play` is now `ReplayIO.verify`, and `ReplayIO.Result` is `ReplayIO.Verification`. The
  operation re-executes a recording to check determinism and draws nothing; `play` implied a human
  watching the game, which the desktop viewer - still to be built - would do. The `replay` CLI
  subcommand and Gradle task are now `verify`. The `Replay` file format keeps its name: a recorded
  run that can be re-executed is a replay.
